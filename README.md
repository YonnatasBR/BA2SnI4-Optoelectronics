This README information about the stored data and folders:

1.***DOS***: density of states calculation for VASP-PBE+D3+SOC-1/2;
2.***BANDS***: two-step electronic band structure calculation for VASP-PBE+D3+SOC-1/2 while calculating (1) charge density and (2) the eigenvalues along a k-path inside the Brillouin Zone (BZ);
3.***vasp2w90&Hamiltonian***: two-step calculation including (1) VASP-PBE+D3+SOC-1/2 to Wannier90 pr√©-wannierization and (2) Wannier90 wannierization to generate the tight-binding-based maximally-localised wannier functions Hamiltonian (MLWF-TB Hamiltonian);
4.***WanTiBEXOS***: mult-step calculation to investigate optoelectronic properties in the scope of the independent particle approximation (IPA) and Beth-Salpeter equations (BSE). we divided it between bandgap, dos, optical properties, excitonic properties, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) calculations.
